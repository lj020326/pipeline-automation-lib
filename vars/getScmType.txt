<h1>Get SCM Type</h1>

<p>
    Lets you quickly get the type of SCM used in the job definition.<br>
    <br>
    For example, if you have a Multibranch Pipeline job, it can checkout from SVN or BitBucket.<br>
    Then you can checkout the code in the pipeline via the shorthand <b>checkout scm</b>.<br>
    If you want to know what SCM was used for this checkout, you can use this method.
</p>

<h2>How to use</h2>

<p>
    Below is an example how you can use the change dsl method from a Jenkins pipeline.
</p>

<p>
    <pre>
    @Library(['stpl-pipeline-core']) _

    node {
        stage('Checkout') {
            checkout scm
        }

        String scmType = ''
        stage('Check SCM Type') {
            scmType = getScmType(scm)
        }
    }
    <pre>
