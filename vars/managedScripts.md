## `execJenkinsShellScript(String scriptId, CommandBuilder commandBuilder null, returnStdout = false, returnStatus = false)`

This step will execute the Jenkins script with the id `scriptId`. The
shell command is build using the provided command builder.

If you want to get the stdout from the execution set `returnStdout` to
`true`. If the status code is needed set `returnStatus` to `true`.

:exclamation: You can only set `returnStdout` or `returnStatus`. If both
are set the `returnStdout` setting will be used.

## `execPipelineShellScript(String scriptPath, CommandBuilder commandBuilder null, returnStdout = false, returnStatus = false)`

This step will execute a managed shell script from the pipeline-library
with path `scriptPath`. The shell command is build using the provided
command builder.

If you want to get the stdout from the execution set `returnStdout` to
`true`. If the status code is needed set `returnStatus` to `true`.
